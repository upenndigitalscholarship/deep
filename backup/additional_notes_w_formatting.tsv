23	Imperfect copy: survives in a single leaf only.
24	Imperfect copy: lacks everything after gathering A.  Since the fragment agrees page for page with Greg 20c, the edition presumably had the same number of leaves and perhaps the same collation (A-C<sup>4</sup>).
30	Imperfect copy: lacks everything before gathering C.
33	Although the play is complete (π1 D-E<sup>4</sup>), only a portion of the book is preserved; presumably eleven leaves are missing, which may have contained another play. Greg calls the title-page woodcut an ornament (<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:98), but Ruth Samson Luborsky and Elizabeth Morley Ingram describe it as an illustration in <i>A Guide to English Illustrated Books, 1536-1603</i> (Tempe: Medieval & Renaissance Texts & Studies, 1998), 1:47.

61	Greg writes, "It seems likely, from the number of copies that survive," that this edition of the play "was also issued independently" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:117).
64	In <i>The Stationers' Company and the Printers of London, 1501-1557</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2013), Peter W. M. Blayney dates this edition to "1551" (Appendix K, 2:1055).

92	The Date of First Production is from the first revised edition of <i>Annals</i> (ed. Harbage and Schoenbaum); second revised edition (ed. Wagonheim) dates the play to the first half of the 17th century.
5011.01	Greg distinguishes variant states in the preliminaries of the collection <i>The First Part of Churchyardes Chippes</i> as 66a(i*) and 66a(i†), erroneously implying that these are variants in <i>The Entertainment in the City of Bristow</i>. 
100	Imperfect copy: lacks gathering A and everything after gathering F.
104	Descriptions printed in black letter, speeches in roman and italic. The pageants are ascribed to various authors: the first and second to "B. G."; the third to "Goldinham"; two sets of farewell verses to "B. G."; the final "Dialogue" to "Sephani Limberti Carmen"; some Greek verses to "W. G."; and some Latin verses to "Gul. Goldingham, Mag.

117	Imperfect copy: lacks everything after gathering E.
119	The name "Paule Bucke" appears in the explicit; the reason for this is uncertain, but there was a Paul Buck who was a player and author (Greg 1:165).

124	The imprint date follows the legal reckoning. The half-title reads [π4v]: "The misfortunes of Arthur (V<i>ther Pendragons Sonne) reduced into Tragicall notes by</i> THOMAS HVGHES <i>one of the societie of</i> Grayes-Inne. <i>And here set downe as it past from vnder his handes and as it was presented, excepting certaine wordes and lines, where some of the Actors either helped their memories by brief omission: or fitted their acting by some alteration.

284	Greg writes that some copies of this edition are quartos and others quarto-form octavos [4° and (4°-form) 8°], but the "quarto-form octavos" are better described as large-paper quartos; see G.T. Tanselle, "The Concept of Format," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 53 (2000): 67-115.
285	The printer attributions are based on those in the Revels edition of the play edited by Helen Ostovich (Manchester UP, 2001) (3). 
286	Greg suggests that this edition possibly "was produced some years after the date" in its imprint (<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:265), but Helen Ostovich in her Revels edition of the play (Manchester UP, 2001) argues that "no typographical evidence contradicts or throws doubt on the 1600 title-page date."

379	In the dedication to the second edition of this masque (Greg 207b), Daniel calls this an unauthorized edition published because of "the vnmannerly presumption of an indiscreet Printer, who without warrant hath divulged the late shewe at Court, presented the 8. of Ianuary, by the Queenes Maiestie and her Ladies, and the same verie disorderly set forth" (A3r).
382	Another impression of engraved plates only [in Greg 208a], without letterpress; therefore, notes Greg, the edition actually contains no dramatic material.

551	Greg calls this edition a quarto-form octavo [(4°-form) 8°], but it is better described as a large-paper quarto; see G.T. Tanselle, "The Concept of Format," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 53 (2000): 67-115. <i>Annals</i> and Suzanne Gossett's Arden3 edition date the first production to 1608 [1606-1608]; <i>William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion</i> dates it to 1607.
5071.01	"The Preface to the Reader" mentions Inigo Jones as the "Architect."
580	An edition of 1612 was reported by William Gifford but is no longer extant, if it ever existed; Greg lists this edition as 304a. <i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this play to 1609, but Martin Butler supplies a "corrected date" of "1610(?)"

605	There is a third edition of <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i> with the year "1635" on its title page (Greg 316b; STC 1675a), but the STC suggests this edition was actually printed around 1661. This edition is not included in DEEP.

669	The end of the text states that the workmanship for the pageant was done by "Master Garret Crismas, and Maister Robert Norman" [D1v].
685	This was probably a pirated edition issued by Francis Kirkman and printed by Thomas Johnson, though Greg calls the evidence "ambiguous" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:513); see Johan Gerritsen, "The Dramatic Piracies of 1661," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 11 (1958): 117-31. We have retained it in DEEP because it may have appeared prior to the end of 1660. There is also an undated edition of this play (Greg 363h), which was printed after 1660 and therefore is not included in DEEP.
687	This masque was originally intended for a court performance at Denmark House by Prince Charles's Men during the winter of 1619-1620, but it is not clear if that performance ever took place. According to G. E. Bentley, it does seem to have been performed shortly thereafter at a theater on the Bankside and, in the 1630s, by Queen Henrietta Maria's Men and Beeston's Boys at the Phoenix/Cockpit theater  (<i>The Jacobean and Caroline Stage</i>, 4:907-11).

690	The end of the text states that the "Frame-Worke" for the pageant was done by "Master Garret Crismas" [B4v].
701	The masque was performed on Jan 6, 1622, so the title page date follows the legal reckoning. STC dates it to 1621. The end of the text states that the invention (partly) and scene (wholly) was by Inigo Jones, and the music by Alphonso Ferrabosco and Nicholas Lanier [B4v].
702	The masque was performed on Jan 6, 1622, so the title page date follows the legal reckoning. STC dates it to 1621.

712	The end of the text states that the "workmanship" of the pageant was done by "Mr. Garret Crismas" [C1v].
717	The masque was prepared for a performance on Jan 6, 1624, which was first postponed and eventually abandoned before being revised into <i>The Fortunate Isles</i>; the title page date follows the legal reckoning.

731	"T<small>ORQVATO</small> T<small>ASSO</small>'<small>S</small> A<small>MINTA</small> Englisht" is xylographic text, part of the engraved illustration on the title page.
736	The title page is cropt at the bottom of the surviving copies, so it is unclear if there was originally an imprint. The end of the text states that the workmanship for the pageant was done by "M. Gerard Chrismas" [C2v].
729	The end of the text states that "the Fabricke or Structure of the whole Tryumph, in so short a time, so gracefully performed, the Commendation of that, the Industry of Maister Garret Chrismas may justly Challenge" [B4r].
730	The title "APOLLO SHROVING" is part of a woodcut image, not letterpress.
732	Engraved title page subscribed "Tho: Cecill. sculp."
733	The imprint on surviving copies is cropped, but Greg writes that "it can still be read with reasonable confidence" (<i>Bibliography</i> 2:570).
737	There is no evidence that this play was ever acted, but Davenant may have written it with the intention that it would eventually be performed by a professional playing company.
751	There is another undated edition of this play, which was printed after 1660 and therefore not included in DEEP.
752	<i>Annals</i> gives the date of Henry Herbert's license for the stage as September 17, but it is actually from April 17 (see N. W. Bawcutt, <i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 151).
753	<i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i> dates the first production to Spring 1613; <i>Annals</i> dates it to 1613 [Mar-Aug(?)].

784	The masque was performed on Jan 8, 1632, so the title page dates follow the legal reckoning.
785	The masque was performed on Feb 14, 1632, so the title page dates follows the legal reckoning. The end of the text states that the verses for the masque were "written by" Aurelian Townshend, and the subject, allegory, descriptions, and apparatus of the scenes "invented by Inigo Jones, Surveyor of his Maiesties worke" [C3v].
786	Greg writes, "This edition was evidently printed to take the place" of the first edition of the play printed for the second volume of Jonson's <i>Works</i>, but he adds, "it is also clear from advertisements ... that copies were sold separately (although none are recorded as now occurring in that state) and it is therefore here treated as an independent edition" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:605-6). There is another issue of this playbook from 1669 [Greg 457b(ii)], which is not included in DEEP.
795	The play was performed on Mar 19, 1632, so the date in the performance attribution on the title page follows the legal reckoning.
803	According to Greg, "This edition appears to have been printed to accompany the Oxford collection of Randolph's <i>Poems &c.</i>, with which it is often bound up, but of which it is neither an integral part nor an invariable companion, and the mention of a Cambridge bookseller in the imprint proves the intention of separate issue. Three years later the remaining stock was included as part of the London collection of Randolph's <i>Poems &c.</i>, 1643, being replaced when exhausted by a reprint dated 1646 [469d]" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:618).
804	According to Greg, "This edition was printed for the later issue of" the 1643 Randolph collection "after the stock of [469c] was exhausted" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:618). It does not seem to have been intended for separate issue.
1077	<i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i> attributes the play to Ford, Dekker, Middleton, and Rowley; <i>Annals</i> attributes it to Ford and Dekker.
813	This play was likely performed by the Red Bull (Revels) Company, but the title page attribution seems to be to the Children of the Queen's Revels; DEEP therefore classifies it under both Adult Professional and Boys Professional.
816	<i>Annals</i> gives the date of Henry Herbert's license for the stage as June 21, but it is actually from January 21 (see N. W. Bawcutt, <i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 178).
826	The masque was performed on Feb 3, 1634, so the title page dates follow the legal reckoning.

913	Greg writes that separate editions of <i>Cleopatra</i> and <i>Julia Agrippina</i> "were printed in 1639, but since the epistle to Sir Kenelm Digby prefixed to <i>Cleopatra</i> is a joint dedication of the two plays, it is clear that these, though otherwise bibliographically distinct, were intended to be issued together as well as separately" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1092). DEEP lists each of these plays only as a single-play playbook, not as part of a collection.

1110	Greg writes that this bibliographically independent issue and that of <i>The Politician</i> "were no doubt designed as a supplement to Shirley's <i>Six New Plays</i> of 1653, and were either added to the unsold copies of that volume or issued as a small informal collection by themselves. It is not known whether they were ever sold singly though they are occasionally found so" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:857).
1114	Greg writes that this bibliographically independent issue and that of <i>The Gentleman of Venice</i> "were no doubt designed as a supplement to Shirley's <i>Six New Plays</i> of 1653, and were either added to the unsold copies of that volume or issued as a small informal collection by themselves. It is not known whether they were ever sold singly though they are occasionally found so" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:857).
1118	Wing attributes this play to Edmund Prestwich.
1119	"The Story Personated" notes that "The Composition of Vocal Musick was performd'd" for the five entries by "Mr. Henry Lawes," "Capt. Henry Cook," and "Mr. Matthew Lock"; and "The Instrumental Musick was compos'd by D<sup>r</sup> Charles Coleman, and M<sup>r</sup> George Hudson" [G1r].
1120	"The Story Personated" notes that "The Composition of Vocal Musick was performd'd" for the five entries by "Mr. Henry Lawes," "Capt.

1144	According to Greg, the first gathering, A<sup>4</sup>, was printed in octavo.
1147	In a few copies, there is found the engraved portrait belonging to <i>Two New Plays</i> (Wing M1989). <i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i> dates the first production to Summer 1611; <i>Annals</i> dates it to c.1611 [revised 1638 (by J. Shirley?)].
1140	The date in the imprint is not legible, but must be 1657 based on the rest of the title page.
1145	According to Greg, the first gathering, A<sup>2</sup>, was printed in octavo.
1146	Transcription of title page inferred by Greg from later book sale catalogue; Greg notes that the location of the one copy of this variant was unknown at the time of his writing.
1148	Greg writes, "There seems no evidence that this play was ever issued independently, though it is sometimes found alone" (<i>Bibliography</i> 2:888). Annals dates this play to 1637 [1622-c.1638], but N. W. Bawcutt supplies a transcript of Henry Herbert's license to the King's Men from September 6, 1622 (<i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 137).
1150	<i>Annals</i> dates Henry Herbert's license for the stage to 1636, but N. W. Bawcutt argues that it is actually from 1630 (<i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 169-70).
1154	The end of the text notes that, "Notwithstanding the great expence necessary to Scenes, and other ornaments in this Entertainment, there is a good provision made of places for a shilling. And it shall begin certainly at 3 after noon" [D4r].
1172	The end of the text states that the workmanship was done by "Capt. Andrew Dakers and Mr. William Lightfoot, Painters: Mr. Thomas Whiting, Ioyner: Mr. Richard Clear, Carver, each of them in their qualities deserving ample commendations" [C4r].
1178	Greg writes, "This piece is bibliographically independent, and the advertisements that occur both before and after it in the collection serve to emphasize the fact. ... It would appear, therefore, that this single piece was meant to be issued separately in advance of the collection. On the other hand, the date on the title, 1659, shows that it was actually printed later than the other four plays, which are all dated 1658; and since the collection appears to have been on the market by January ..., there can have been little time for previous issue; moreover, the fact that no copies have been met with apart from the collection makes it unlikely that any such independent issue was made" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:909).
1205	According to STC, the title page exists in two states. One copy has the colon in its first line: "LABYRINTHVS: C<small>OM</small>œ<small>DIA</small>"; four copies do not have it: "LABYRINTHVS C<small>OM</small>œ<small>DIA</small>".
5005	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to one or another edition of the individual publications STC 18679.5, 18685.3, 18678, 18679, 18678a, and 18685 (Greg 39b).
5005.01	The play was performed in January 1562, so the date in the performance attribution follows the legal reckoning.
5172	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to separate editions of the two plays published in 1640.
5009	The majority of the book is in black letter, with a few texts printed in roman. Although the imprint of this edition lists only the printer Abel Jeffes, the <i>STC</i> identifies Richard Smith as the book's publisher (3:277).
5009.04	The speeches in this entertainment are ascribed to several authors: "M. Hunneys master of her Maiesties Chapell"; "master Badger of Oxenforde, Maister of ARte, and Bedle"; "M. Ferrers, sometime Lord of misrule in the Court"; "master Muncaster"; "Goldingham"; and Gascoigne.
5010	The majority of the book is in black letter, with a few texts printed in roman. Although the imprint of this edition lists only the printer Abel Jeffes, the <i>STC</i> identifies Richard Smith as the book's publisher (3:277).
5027	Greg classifies this book as a 12mo, but notes that its format is uncertain. STC classifies it as a 16mo in eights.

5072	Greg calls this collection "unusual." He writes, "It is possible that the printer intended two simultaneous issues, one containing the oath-day entertainment only [311a(*)], the other the election entertainment as well [312a]. It seems more likely, however, that when the copy for the latter [312a] was received the type of the four sheets of the earlier issue [311a(*)] was still standing, and that advantage was taken of the fact to print a further impression [311a(†)] ... and append new matter to it" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:455).
5034	William Alexander's Supplements, STC 22544a.3 (London, 1617?) and STC 22544a.5 (London, 1617?), are sometimes bound with this edition. This is the sixth edition of <i>The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</i>, but only the fourth containing <i>The Entertainment at Wanstead</i> [Greg 152d].

The other plays apparently intended for inclusion in the collection were: <i>A Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Henry the Fifth</i>, <i>1 Sir John Oldcastle</i>, and <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.

5100.01	Engraved title page subscribed "Tho: Cecill. sculp."
5044	This is the ninth edition of <i>The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</i>, but only the seventh containing <i>The Entertainment at Wanstead</i> [Greg 152g]. The listing of Downes as publisher is from STC.
5095	Imperfect copy: the only surviving copy has a defective title page, in which missing letters have been added in handwritten facsimile, of unknown date and provenance.
5111	Some copies are found, and may have been issued, bound up with the 1634 edition of <i>The Jealous Lovers</i> [Greg 469b]. The two plays in the collection, <i>The Muses' Looking-Glass</i> and <i>Amyntas</i>, may have been issued separately from the rest of the volume.
5107	Greg identifies this collection as 543a(i*)-544a(i*).
5045	This is the tenth edition of <i>The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</i>, but only the eighth containing <i>The Entertainment at Wanstead</i> [Greg 152h]. Collation, content, and leaf count based on Bent Juel-Jensen, "Sir Philip Sidney, 1554-1586: A Check-List of Early Editions of His Works," <i>Sir Philip Sidney: An Anthology of Modern Criticism</i>, ed. Dennis Kay (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987), 289-314. Juel-Jensen lists a variant state of the title page, with "dedilcated" for "dedicated," and copies with variant states of the preliminaries.
5109	Greg identifies this collection as 543a(ii*)-544a(ii*). The bookseller name is from STC. 
5110	Greg identifies this collection as 543a(ii†)-544a(ii†). The bookseller name is from STC.
5108	Greg identifies this collection as 543a(i†)-544a(i†).
5118	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to separate editions of individual plays published from 1637 to 1640. The bookseller attribution is from STC.
5124.12	The masque was probably performed on Aug 19, 1624; the HT date is an error.
5118.04	According to STC, John Dawson (2) printed the cancel title page for this issue.
5118.06	According to STC, John Dawson (2) printed the cancel title page for this issue.
5118.10	This play was never acted, but Nabbes wrote it with the intention that it would be performed by a professional company in London.
5126.01	The masque was performed on Feb 18, 1634, so the date in the performance attribution on the title page follows the legal reckoning. The end of the text states that "The Songs and Dialogues of this Booke were set with apt Tunes to them, by M<sup>r</sup>. Henry Lawes, one of His Majesties Musitians" [S4v].
5124	Greg writes that the second and third volumes "are usually found bound together." The second volume was "originally printed by John Beale for Robert Allot" in 1631, and was reissued by the publisher Richard Meighen in 1640. The third volume "was printed for and presumably published by Thomas Walkley (though [Andrew] Crooke and John Benson both claimed interest in some of the copies it included)" (Greg, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1075); it was the subject of a Bill in Chancery in January 1641, which records "a great deal about the circumstances of publication" (Greg, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1081). 
5124.13	The masque was performed on Jan 9, 1625; the date in the HT is an error.
5124.16	A note at the end states "Perform'd, the xxi. of May. 1633" [2O4v].
5124.18	There is no evidence that this play was ever acted--since it exists only as a fragment of sixty-nine lines, dramatis personae, and a short argument--but Jonson was apparently writing it with the intention that it would eventually be performed by a professional playing company.
5124.21	There is no evidence that this play was ever acted--since it exists only as a fragment of just over two acts--but Jonson was apparently writing it with the intention that it would eventually be performed by a professional playing company.
5124.04	The masque was performed on Jan 6, 1618; the date in the HT is an error. A note at the end states "This pleas'd the King so well, as he would see it againe, when it was presented with these additions" (i.e., Part II, <i>For the Honour of Wales</i>) [E3r].
5124.14	The masque was performed on Jan 9, 1631, so the HT date follows the legal reckoning.
5124.11	The date in the HT is an error. <i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this masque to July 19(?), 1620, but Martin Butler convincingly argues it should be January 6, 1621 ("Ben Jonson's <i>Pan's Anniversary</i> and the Politics of Early Stuart Pastoral," <i>English Literary Renaissance</i>, 22 [1992]: 369-404).
5125	Greg writes that the second and third volumes "are usually found bound together." The second volume was "originally printed by John Beale for Robert Allot" in 1631, and was reissued by the publisher Richard Meighen in 1640. The third volume "was printed for and presumably published by Thomas Walkley (though [Andrew] Crooke and John Benson both claimed interest in some of the copies it included)" (Greg, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1075); it was the subject of a Bill in Chancery in January 1641, which records "a great deal about the circumstances of publication" (Greg, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1081). 
5125.01	There is another issue of this play from 1669 [Greg 457b(ii)], which is not included in DEEP.
5074.25	The description notes that the dances were made by Thomas Giles and Hierome Herne, the music by Alphonso Ferrabosco, and the device and scenery by Inigo Jones.
5076.04	The imprint records Robert Young as the printer, but Greg notes that the printing was actually done by Richard Bishop.
5076.15	The description notes Jonson's collaboration with Inigo Jones.
5076.16	The description notes that Thomas Giles made the dances.
5076.18	The description notes that the dances were made by Thomas Giles and Hierome Herne, the music by Alphonso Ferrabosco, and the device and scenery by Inigo Jones.
5076.05	<i>Annals</i>  dates the first production of this play to 1603, but Martin Butler supplies a "corrected date" of "1604(?)" ("The Riddle of Jonson's Chronology Revisited," <i>The Library</i>, 7th series, 4 [2003]: 49-63).
5076.19	The description notes that the costumes, invention, architecture of the scenery, and machine were made by Inigo Jones; the dances designed by Heirome Herne and by Thomas Giles; one song sung by John Allen; and the music composed by Alphonso Ferrabosco.
5076.07	An edition of 1612 was reported by William Gifford but is no longer extant, if it ever existed; Greg lists this edition as 304a. <i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this play to 1609, but Martin Butler supplies a "corrected date" of "1610(?)" ("The Riddle of Jonson's Chronology Revisited," <i>The Library</i>, 7th series, 4 [2003]: 49-63).
5076.27	<i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this masque to 1615, but Martin Butler supplies a "corrected date" of 1616 ("The Riddle of Jonson's Chronology Revisited," <i>The Library</i>, 7th series, 4 [2003]: 49-63).
5120	Greg identifies this collection as 585a(i*).
5120.01	There is only one STC number for the collection <i>Q. Horatius Flaccus: His Art of Poetry</i>. But there are two issues of the collection, while <i>The Gypsies Metamorphosed</i> exists in two states. Greg's description of this collection and this masque conflates variants affecting the collection (* and †) and variants affecting only the masque (i and ii).
5121	Greg identifies this collection as 585a(i†).
5123	Greg identifies this collection as 585a(ii†).
5120.02	There is only one STC number for the collection <i>Q. Horatius Flaccus: His Art of Poetry</i>. But there are two issues of the collection, while <i>The Gypsies Metamorphosed</i> exists in two states. Greg's description of this collection and this masque conflates variants affecting the collection (* and †) and variants affecting only the masque (i and ii).
5112	This collection is often bound up with the 1640 edition of <i>The Jealous Lovers</i> [Greg 469c].
5113	This collection is often bound up with the 1640 edition of <i>The Jealous Lovers</i> [Greg 469c]. This issue is not in Greg or in EEBO; the transcription for its imprint has been derived from ESTC.
5132.02	<i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this play to 1636, but N. W. Bawcutt supplies a transcript of Henry Herbert's license from 1639: "<i>Claricilla</i>--Thomas Killigrew, allowed 1639" (<i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 204).
5127.01	The masque was performed on Feb 18, 1634, so the date in the performance attribution on the title page follows the legal reckoning. The end of the text states that "The Songs and Dialogues of this Booke were set with apt Tunes to them, by M<sup>r</sup>. Henry Lawes, one of His Majesties Musitians" [S6v].
5114.04	According to Greg, "This edition was printed for the later issue of" the 1643 Randolph collection "after the stock of [469c] was exhausted" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:618). It does not seem to have been intended for separate issue.
5114.03	According to Greg, "This edition appears to have been printed to accompany the Oxford collection of Randolph's <i>Poems &c.</i>, with which it is often bound up, but of which it is neither an integral part nor an invariable companion, and the mention of a Cambridge bookseller in the imprint proves the intention of separate issue. Three years later the remaining stock was included as part of the London collection of Randolph's <i>Poems &c.</i>, 1643, being replaced when exhausted by a reprint dated 1646 [469d]" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 2:618).
5135	The variant states of this edition correspond in Wing and Greg as follows: Wing S6126=Greg †<sup>1</sup>; Wing S6126A=Greg *<sup>1</sup>; Wing S6126B=Greg *<sup>1</sup>.
5136	The variant states of this edition correspond in Wing and Greg as follows: Wing S6126=Greg †<sup>1</sup>; Wing S6126A=Greg *<sup>1</sup>; Wing S6126B=Greg *<sup>1</sup>.
5137	The variant states of this edition correspond in Wing and Greg as follows: Wing S6126=Greg †<sup>1</sup>; Wing S6126A=Greg *<sup>1</sup>; Wing S6126B=Greg *<sup>1</sup>.
5143.16	<i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i> dates the first production to September 1622; <i>Annals</i> dates it to 1616 [c.1615-1616].
5143.26	<i>Annals</i> gives the date of Henry Herbert's re-license for the stage as 1624, but it is actually from 1625 (see N. W. Bawcutt, <i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 160).
5143.30	The modern author attribution is based on <i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i>, 375-77. In Fredson Bowers, gen. ed., <i>The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon</i>, vol. 10 (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1996), 751-52, the play is attributed to Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and John Fletcher.
5145.02	<i>Annals</i> dates the first production of this play to 1639-1642, but N. W. Bawcutt supplies a transcript of Henry Herbert's license from 1641: "Variety Com: with several reformations made by Shirley 1641. My Lo<sup>d</sup> Newcastle, as is said hath some hand in it. 1641 allowed upon review without exception" (<i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 209).
5128.01	The masque was performed on Feb 18, 1634, so the date in the performance attribution on the title page follows the legal reckoning. The end of the text states that "The Songs and Dialogues of this Booke were set with apt Tunes to them, by Mr. Henry Lawes, one of His Majesties Musicians" [O8v].
5046	This is the eleventh edition of <i>The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</i>, but only the ninth containing <i>The Entertainment at Wanstead</i> [Greg 152i]. Collation and content based on Bent Juel-Jensen, "Sir Philip Sidney, 1554-1586: A Check-List of Early Editions of His Works," <i>Sir Philip Sidney: An Anthology of Modern Criticism</i>, ed. Dennis Kay (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987), 289-314.
5147	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to separate editions of individual plays published from 1598 to 1608.
5147.03	In the woodcut "AL FOOLES," the final S is turned backwards.
5148	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to separate editions of individual plays published from 1602 to 1631.
264	This edition is not in Greg; we have therefore identified it as Greg 151π. Imperfect copy: survives in five leaves only. This edition was identified by Richard Proudfoot, who found its five leaves inserted in a copy of Greg 151o (Wing G1829) held at the Folger Shakespeare Library. See Proudfoot, "'Modernizing' the Printed Play-Text in Jacobean London: Some Early Reprints of <i>Mucedorus</i>," in Linda Anderson and Janis Lull, eds., <i>"A Certain Text": Close Readings and Textual Studies on Shakespeare and Others in Honor of Thomas Clayton</i> (Newark: U of Delaware P, 2002), 18-28. 
5153.03	This play was performed by Beeston's Boys, but the title-page company attribution is to the King's Men; DEEP therefore classifies it under both Boys Professional and Adult Professional.
5155.06	This play was never acted before the theaters closed in 1642, but Shirley wrote it with the intention that it would be performed by the King's Men at the Blackfriars.
5154	The cancel title-leaf (A1) is in quarto; the rest of collection is in octavo.
5158	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to separate editions of the two plays reissued in 1654.
5170.02	Annals dates this play to 1637 [1622-c.1638], but N. W. Bawcutt supplies a transcript of Henry Herbert's license to the King's Men from September 6, 1622 (<i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Clarendon, 1996], 137).
5171	Moseley's address to readers [A3r] appears after the title page for <i>More Dissemblers Besides Women</i> [A2r], but it is intended for both plays.  Nathaniel Richards's commendatory poem [A4r] specifically addresses <i>Women Beware Women</i>.
5171.01	Moseley's address to readers appears after the title page for <i>More Dissemblers Besides Women</i> but is intended for both plays. <i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i> dates the first production to 1614; <i>Annals</i> dates it to c.1615(?) [re-licensed for stage, Oct 17, 1623].
5171.02	<i>Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture</i> dates the first production to Summer 1621; <i>Annals</i> dates it to 1621 [c.1620-1627]; Richard Dutton, ed., <i>"Women Beware Women" and Other Plays</i> (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1999) suggests a date of 1613.
5173.01	The masque was performed on Jan 6, 1640, so the date in the HT follows the legal reckoning
5176	Greg identifies this issue as Issue (<small>B</small>).
5176.01	<i>The City Match</i> was first performed in private court performances and afterward by the King's Men at the Blackfriars.
5179.01	Greg distinguishes between the three issues of the two-play 1659 Shirley collection as 473b(i)-789a(i), 473(bii)-789a(ii), and 473b(iii)-789a(iii), but <i>Honoria and Mammon</i> remains unchanged in each issue.
5179.02	The text contains a note that a song "was afterwards sung in parts, the Musick excellently composed by Mr. Ed. Coleman [K2v]. Greg distinguishes between the three issues of the two-play 1659 Shirley collection as 473b(i)-789a(i), 473(bii)-789a(ii), and 473b(iii)-789a(iii), but <i>The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses</i> remains unchanged in each issue.
5139	There is also an imperfect copy of a later edition of <i>Fragmenta Aurea</i>, which lacks all leaves before N1. It is bound up with a copy of <i>The Last Remains</i> (1672?) but was presumably printed earlier and closely resembles the edition of 1658. This edition is not included in DEEP.
5140.04	There is no evidence that this play was ever acted--it is described by the publisher of <i>The Last Remains of Sir John Suckling</i> as an "unfinish'd" fragment--but Suckling may have written it with the intention that it would eventually be performed by a professional playing company.
5182.03	A play with the title <i>Love Sick Courtier</i> was licensed by Henry Herbert for Queen Henrietta Maria's Men at the Salisbury Court theater in 1638, which may have been this play (N. W. Bawcutt, ed., <i>The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama</i> [Oxford: Clarendon, 1996], 202).
5016	This is the third edition of <i>The Serpent of Division</i>, but the first containing <i>Ferrex and Porrex</i> [Greg 39c].
135	Although Greg considers this edition to be "bibliographically independent" (<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:178), STC labels it simply as "pt. 2 of 14644" and therefore does not classify it as a separate independent issue. 
5126.02	The masque was performed on Feb 18, 1634, so the date in the performance attribution on the title page follows the legal reckoning. The end of the text states that "The Songs and Dialogues of this Booke were set with apt Tunes to them, by M<sup>r</sup>. Henry Lawes, one of His Majesties Musitians" [S4v].
5122	Greg identifies this collection as 585a(ii*).
5004.01	Greg calls this edition a quarto-form octavo [(4°-form) 8°], but it is better described as a large-paper quarto; see G.T. Tanselle, "The Concept of Format," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 53 (2000): 67-115.
125	This edition is now completely lost, with the only known copy having burned in a fire at the Free Public Library in Birmingham, England, in January 1879. Greg writes: "The description given ... has been compiled from a reprint of the entertainment included in <i>Kenilworth Illustrated</i> (printed by C. Whittingham, Chiswick, 1821)" [<i>Bibliography</i>, 1:168], and he notes that there is a tracing of the original title page in ULC [<i>Bibliography</i>, 4:1667]. Greg assigns no number to this edition, which we have therefore identified as 90π.
5026.01	Greg only included an entry for the collection but noted later that it "includes three distinct pieces and should have been given three numbers" (Bibliography, 4:1668). DEEP assigns a distinct Greg number for each of the plays in collection.
5026.02	Greg only included an entry for the collection but noted later that it "includes three distinct pieces and should have been given three numbers" (Bibliography, 4:1668). DEEP assigns a distinct Greg number for each of the plays in collection.
5026.03	Greg only included an entry for the collection but noted later that it "includes three distinct pieces and should have been given three numbers" (Bibliography, 4:1668). DEEP assigns a distinct Greg number for each of the plays in collection.
5177	Greg identifies this issue as Issue (<small>A</small>).
5178	Greg identifies this issue as Issue (<small>C</small>).
5183	This collection was also included, without the engraved frontispiece, in the second issue of the 1658 edition of <i>Fragmenta Aurea</i> [Wing S6128].
5140	There is also an imperfect copy of a later edition of <i>Fragmenta Aurea</i>, which lacks all leaves before N1. It is bound up with a copy of <i>The Last Remains</i> (1672?) but was presumably printed earlier and closely resembles the edition of 1658. This edition is not included in DEEP.
827	The masque was performed on Feb 3, 1634, so the title page dates follow the legal reckoning.  The end of the text states that the "Scene and Ornament" for the masque were made by "Inigo Iones Esquire, Surueyer of his Maiesties workes"; and the "composition of the music" performed by "Mr. William Lawes, and Mr. Simon Ives" [D4v].
829	The masque was performed on Feb 3, 1634, so the title page dates follow the legal reckoning.  The end of the text states that the "Scene and Ornament" for the masque were made by "Inigo Iones Esquire, Surueyer of his Maiesties workes"; and the "composition of the music" performed by "Mr. William Lawes, and Mr. Simon Ives" [D4v].
917	Greg writes, <i>Bibliography</i>, 3:1092: "Separate editions of the two plays [553, 554] were printed in 1639, but since the epistle to Sir Kenelm Digby prefixed to <i>Cleopatra</i> is a joint dedication of the two plays, it is clear that these, though otherwise bibliographically distinct, were intended to be issued together as well as separately." DEEP lists each of these plays only as a single-play playbook, not as part of a collection.
5071	The masque was performed on Tuesday, the day following Prince Henry's creation, not on "Wednesday," as the title page states.
136	This edition is not in Greg; we have therefore identified it as 103π.
852	This was probably a pirated edition issued by Francis Kirkman and printed by Thomas Johnson; see Johan Gerritsen, "The Dramatic Piracies of 1661," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 11 (1958): 117-31. We have retained it in DEEP because it may have appeared prior to the end of 1660.
5149	For this collection, a single leaf has been prefixed to separate editions of individual plays published from 1629 to 1639. This collection is not in Greg's <i>Bibliography</i>; see Marion Linton, "National Library of Scotland and Edinburgh University Library Copies of Plays in Greg's <i>Bibliography of the English Printed Drama</i>," <i>Studies in Bibliography</i> 15 (1962): 91-104, 104<i>n</i>3.
79	This edition is not in Greg; we have therefore identified it as Greg 51π. Imperfect copy: survives in four leaves only. See Paul Morgan, "Fragments of Three Lost Works from the Stationers' Registers Recently Found in Bindings in College Libraries," <i>Bodleian Library Record</i> 7.6 (Feb. 1967): 300-2. In <i>The Stationers' Company and the Printers of London, 1501-1557</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2013), Peter W. M. Blayney dates this edition to "1558" (Appendix K, 2:1048).
38	This edition is not in Greg. Imperfect copy: survives in only five fragments composing most of leaves E1 and E3.
